# eaglercraft

Combines 1.5 and 1.8 Eaglercraft servers together!

## how is it back?
#### The difference is, this replit removes the client itself, so NO DMCA IS POSSIBLE!! This is now a server-only hosting solution, NOT a client hosting solution. DO NOT upload the client to your Replit; it will break their rules. Honestly, have some respect for Mojang. It's literally always said "Do not distribute!" so like, cmon, be reasonable and don't put the client on your replit. Thanks.

## looking for the client?
well, look elsewhere buddy, because you're not gonna find it here.

### Server supports most if not all Bukkit/Spigot 1.8 plugins. Here are a few to get you started:
- [AuthMeReloaded](https://github.com/AuthMe/AuthMeReloaded/releases) (Set max reg per ip in the config to a very large number, and turn off listing other accounts)
- [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) (Permissions manager with an AWESOME web ui)
- [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/downloads.html) (Since replit projects are usually public, please do not use EssentialsXDiscord, unless you *want* your bot token to get stolen)
- [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit/files/2460562) (World manipulation plugin, very cool)
- [AsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/SBPrime/AsyncWorldEdit/releases/tag/v3.5.4) (requires WorldEdit) (Makes Worldedit faster)

### Obligatory server plugs
- **[TotalFreedom](https://totalfreedom.me)** - Free OP server since 2010 (NOT Eaglercraft compatible) **GRIEF=BAN** IP: `play.totalfreedom.me`
- **Creacraft/Creayun** - My creative anarchy server, inspired by Creacraft Free OP from back in the day. **WARNING: NO FILTERS, ONLY RULE IS DON'T BE A CREEP** (Eaglercraft compatible) IP: `sus.shhnowisnottheti.me`
- **[Kaboom.pw](https://kaboom.pw)** - The most "free op" you can get. (NOT Eaglercraft compatible) IP: `play.kaboom.pw`
